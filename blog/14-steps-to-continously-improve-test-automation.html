                            <h3>1. Scripting</h3> <br>
                            <p>
                                One of the primary areas for improvement in TAS is scripting. Effective scripting can
                                significantly reduce manual intervention and streamline the testing process. Here are
                                some strategies to enhance scripting:
                            </p>
                            <u>Assess Test Case Overlap:</u>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Consolidate automated tests by identifying and removing overlaps in test cases,
                                    steps, and procedures.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <u>Error Recovery Processes:</u>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Establish robust error recovery processes for both the TAS and the System Under Test
                                    (SUT) to handle unexpected failures efficiently.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <u>Evaluate Wait Mechanisms:</u>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hard-coded Waits: Fixed time delays, though often inefficient.</li>
                                <li>Dynamic Waiting by Polling: Continuously checking for a condition to be met.</li>
                                <li>Event Mechanisms of the SUT: Subscribing to events that trigger actions when
                                    specific conditions are met.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <u>Treat Testware as Software:</u>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Apply software development principles to testware to enhance its maintainability and
                                    scalability.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <u>Evaluate Existing Scripts:</u>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Regularly review and revise existing scripts to eliminate redundancies and improve
                                    performance.</li>

                                Refactoring the Test Automation Architecture (TAA) to accommodate changes in the SUT is
                                crucial:

                                <li>Avoid bolt-on extensions. Instead, analyze and implement changes at the
                                    architectural level to ensure a robust automated solution.
